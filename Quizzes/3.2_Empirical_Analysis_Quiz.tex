	\subsection*{Question 1 (2 point)}
	Give the percent composition for all elements in the following compounds:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \vspace{0.5em} \ch{NO2}
		\item \vspace{2em} \ch{C2H5Cl}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{1.5em}
	\subsection*{Question 2 (2 points)}
	Give the empirical formula for compounds with the following compositions:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \vspace{0.5em} $82.66\%$ \ch{C} and $17.34\%$ \ch{H}
		\item \vspace{6em} $62.04\%$ \ch{C}, $10.41\%$ \ch{H}, and $27.55\%$ \ch{O}
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\vspace{6em}
	\subsection*{Question 3 (1 point)}
	What are the molecular formulas for the compounds in Question 2 if their molecular weights are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \vspace{0.5em} $58.12~\nicefrac{g}{mol}$
		\item \vspace{1.5em} $116.16~\nicefrac{g}{mol}$
	\end{itemize}
	 

	\subsection*{Question 5 (2 points)}
	$1.25~g$ of an unknown are combusted in excess \ch{O2} to produce $4.28~g$ of \ch{CO2} and $0.730~g$ of \ch{H2O}. A separate analysis gave the compound's molar mass as $154.211~\nicefrac{g}{mol}$
	
	\noindent Give the empirical and molecular formulas for the unknown substance

	\vspace{17em}
	\subsection*{Question 6 (3 points)}
	$2.75~g$ of an unknown are combusted in excess \ch{O2} to produce $3.94~g$ of \ch{CO2} and $2.15~g$ of \ch{H2O}. A separate analysis gave the compound's molar mass as $92.095~\nicefrac{g}{mol}$
	
	\noindent Give the empirical and molecular formulas for the unknown substance

\paragraph{By Christina Rossetti}~
\begin{verse}
	Who has seen the wind?\\
	Neither I nor you:\\
	But when the leaves hang trembling,\\
	The wind is passing through.

	Who has seen the wind?\\
	Neither you nor I:\\
	But when the trees bow down their heads,\\
	The wind is passing by.
