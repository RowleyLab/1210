\section*{\emph{Caged Bird}}
\paragraph{By Maya Angelou}~
\begin{verse}
	A free bird leaps\\
	on the back of the wind\\
	and floats downstream\\
	till the current ends\\
	and dips his wing\\
	in the orange sun rays\\
	and dares to claim the sky.

	But a bird that stalks\\
	down his narrow cage\\
	can seldom see through\\
	his bars of rage\\
	his wings are clipped and\\
	his feet are tied\\
	so he opens his throat to sing.

	The caged bird sings\\
	with a fearful trill\\
	of things unknown\\
	but longed for still\\
	and his tune is heard\\
	on the distant hill\\
	for the caged bird\\
	sings of freedom.

	The free bird thinks of another breeze\\
	and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees\\
	and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn\\
	and he names the sky his own

	But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams\\
	his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream\\
	his wings are clipped and his feet are tied\\
	so he opens his throat to sing.\\

	The caged bird sings\\
	with a fearful trill\\
	of things unknown\\
	but longed for still\\
	and his tune is heard\\
	on the distant hill\\
	for the caged bird\\
	sings of freedom.\\
\end{verse}
