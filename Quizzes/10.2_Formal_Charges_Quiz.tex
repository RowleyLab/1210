	\subsection*{Problem 1 (2 points)}
	The strength of formic acid \ch{CHOOH} comes from the stability of the formate ion \ch{CHO2^-}, which exhibits \emph{resonance} in its double-bond.
	
	\noindent Draw all the approriate resonance structures, as well as the hybrid structure for the formate ion

	\subsection*{Question 2 (2 points)}
	Thiocyanate ion, \ch{SCN^-}, has \ch{C} as the central atom. Give three guesses for the Lewis structure for \ch{SCN^-}, and list the formal charges for all three atoms in the structures.
	
	\vspace{16em}
	\subsection*{Question 3 (1 point)}
	Which of the three structures above is the \emph{best}, and why

\section*{\emph{Your World}}
\paragraph{By Georgia Douglas Johnson}~
\begin{verse}
	Your world is as big as you make it.\\
	I know, for I used to abide\\
	In the narrowest nest in a corner,\\
	My wings pressing close to my side.

	But I sighted the distant horizon\\
	Where the skyline encircled the sea\\
	And I throbbed with a burning desire\\
	To travel this immensity.

	I battered the cordons around me\\
	And cradled my wings on the breeze,\\
	Then soared to the uttermost reaches\\
	With rapture, with power, with ease!
\end{verse}
