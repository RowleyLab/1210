	\subsection*{Problem 1 (2 points)}
	The strength of formic acid \ch{CHOOH} comes from the stability of the formate ion \ch{CHO2^-}, which exhibits \emph{resonance} in its double-bond.
	
	\noindent Draw all the approriate resonance structures, as well as the hybrid structure for the formate ion

	\subsection*{Question 2 (2 points)}
	Thiocyanate ion, \ch{SCN^-}, has \ch{C} as the central atom. Give three guesses for the Lewis structure for \ch{SCN^-}, and list the formal charges for all three atoms in the structures.
	
	\vspace{16em}
	\subsection*{Question 3 (1 point)}
	Which of the three structures above is the \emph{best}, and why
