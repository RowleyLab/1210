	\subsection*{Problem 1 (2 points)}
	The temperature in Cedar city can range over the year from $-10~^\circ C$ and $35~^\circ C$
	
	\noindent Find the $v_{rms}$ for nitrogen gas at $-10~^\circ C$ and $35~^\circ C$

	\subsection*{Problem 2 (2 points)}
	Two identical balloons are each filled with gas to equal volumes. One balloon contains \ch{He} and the other contains \ch{O2}. Identical pinholes are punched into both balloons at the same time, and it takes $73~s$ for the \ch{He} balloon to deflate to half its initial volume. How long would you predict it will take the \ch{O2} balloon to deflate to half its original volume?

	\subsection*{Problem 3 (1 point)}
	The van Der Waals equation improves the ideal gas law by adding in two new parameters: $a$ and $b$
	
	\noindent Briefly describe what physical properties each of these two parameters relates to:
