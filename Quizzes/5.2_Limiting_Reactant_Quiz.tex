	\noindent
	For \emph{all} questions, consider the following reaction: \ch{2 Al + 6 HCl -> 2 AlCl3 + 3 H2}
	
	\subsection*{Question 1 (2 points)}
	If you $0.500~g$ of \ch{Al} with $1.500~g$ of \ch{HCl}, which reactant will be the limiting reactant?
	
	\vspace{13em}
	\subsection*{Question 2 (2 points)}
	How many $g$ of each product will be produced?
	
	\vspace{13em}
	\subsection*{Question 3 (1 point)} 
	How many $g$ of the excess reactant will remain after the reaction?
