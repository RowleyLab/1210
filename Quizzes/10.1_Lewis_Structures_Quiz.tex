\section*{\emph{Good Bones}}
\paragraph{By Maggie Smith}~
\begin{verse}
	Life is short, though I keep this from my children.\\
	Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine\\
	in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,\\
	a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways\\
	I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least\\
	fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative\\
	estimate, though I keep this from my children.\\
	For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.\\
	For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,\\
	sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world\\
	is at least half terrible, and for every kind\\
	stranger, there is one who would break you,\\
	though I keep this from my children. I am trying\\
	to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,\\
	walking you through a real shithole, chirps on\\
	about good bones: This place could be beautiful,\\
	right? You could make this place beautiful.
