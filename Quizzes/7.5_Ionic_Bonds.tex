\section*{\emph{Because I Could Not Stop for Death (479)}}
\paragraph{By Emily Dickinson}~
\begin{verse}
	Because I could not stop for Death –\\
	He kindly stopped for me –\\
	The Carriage held but just Ourselves –\\
	And Immortality.

	We slowly drove – He knew no haste\\
	And I had put away\\
	My labor and my leisure too,\\
	For His Civility –

	We passed the School, where Children strove\\
	At Recess – in the Ring –\\
	We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –\\
	We passed the Setting Sun –

	Or rather – He passed Us –\\
	The Dews drew quivering and Chill –\\
	For only Gossamer, my Gown –\\
	My Tippet – only Tulle –

	We paused before a House that seemed\\
	A Swelling of the Ground –\\
	The Roof was scarcely visible –\\
	The Cornice – in the Ground –

	Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet\\
	Feels shorter than the Day\\
	I first surmised the Horses' Heads\\
	Were toward Eternity –
\end{verse}
