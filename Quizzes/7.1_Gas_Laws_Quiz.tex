	\subsection*{Problem 1 (1 point)}
	A gas occupies $2.50~L$ at $0.95~atm$ of pressure and a temperature of $274.5~K$. After a change in $P$, $V$, and $T$ the new volume is $5.45~L$ and the new pressure is $0.67~atm$. What is the new temperature?

	\subsection*{Problem 2 (2 points)}
	A gas occupies $1.75~L$ at $1.24~atm$ of pressure and a temperature of $12.4^\circ C$. After a change in $P$, $V$, and $T$ the new volume is $1.38~L$ and the new temperature is $53.5^\circ C$. What is the new pressure?
