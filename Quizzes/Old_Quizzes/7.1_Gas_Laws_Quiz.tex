	\subsection*{Problem 1 (1 point)}
	A gas occupies $2.50~L$ at $0.95~atm$ of pressure and a temperature of $274.5~K$. After a change in $P$, $V$, and $T$ the new volume is $5.45~L$ and the new pressure is $0.67~atm$. What is the new temperature?

\section*{\emph{Pioneers}}
\paragraph{By Carol Lynn Pearson}~
\begin{verse}
	My people were Mormon pioneers.\\
	Is the blood still good?\\
	They stood in awe as truth\\
	Flew by like a dove\\
	And dropped a feather in the West.\\
	Where truth flies you follow\\
	If you are a pioneer.\\
	I have searched the skies\\
	And now and then\\
	Another feather has fallen.\\
	I have packed the handcart again\\
	Packed it with the precious things\\
	And thrown away the rest.\\
	I will sing by the fires at night\\
	Out there on uncharted ground\\
	Where I am my own captain of tens\\
	Where I blow the bugle\\
	Bring myself to morning prayer\\
	Map out the miles\\
	And never know when or where\\
	Or if at all I will finally say,\\
	“This is the place,”\\
	I face the plains\\
	On a good day for walking.\\
	The sun rises\\
	And the mist clears.\\
	I will be all right:\\
	My people were Mormon Pioneers.
\end{verse}
