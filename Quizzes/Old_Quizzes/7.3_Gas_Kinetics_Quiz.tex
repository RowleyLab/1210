	\subsection*{Problem 1 (2 points)}
	The temperature in Cedar city can range over the year from $-10~^\circ C$ and $35~^\circ C$
	
	\noindent Find the $v_{rms}$ for nitrogen gas at $-10~^\circ C$ and $35~^\circ C$
	
	\vspace{10em}
	\subsection*{Problem 2 (2 points)}
	Two identical balloons are each filled with gas to equal volumes. One balloon contains \ch{He} and the other contains \ch{O2}. Identical pinholes are punched into both balloons at the same time, and it takes $73~s$ for the \ch{He} balloon to deflate to half its initial volume. How long would you predict it will take the \ch{O2} balloon to deflate to half its original volume?
	
	\vspace{10em}
	\subsection*{Problem 3 (1 point)}
	The van Der Waals equation improves the ideal gas law by adding in two new parameters: $a$ and $b$
	
	\noindent Briefly describe what physical properties each of these two parameters relates to:

\paragraph{By Kaylin Haught}~
\begin{verse}
	I asked God if it was okay to be melodramatic\\
	and she said yes\\
	I asked her if it was okay to be short\\
	and she said it sure is\\
	I asked her if I could wear nail polish\\
	or not wear nail polish\\
	and she said honey\\
	she calls me that sometimes\\
	she said you can do just exactly\\
	what you want to\\
	Thanks God I said\\
	And is it even okay if I don’t paragraph\\
	my letters\\
	Sweetcakes God said\\
	who knows where she picked that up\\
	what I’m telling you is\\
	Yes Yes Yes
