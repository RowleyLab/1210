\section*{\emph{When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer}}
\paragraph{By Walt Whitman}~

\begin{verse}
	When I heard the learn’d astronomer,\\
	When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\\
	When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\\
	When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,\\
	How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\\
	Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,\\
	In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\\
	Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
\end{verse}
