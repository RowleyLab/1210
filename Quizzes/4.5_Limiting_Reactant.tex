	\noindent
	For \emph{all} questions, consider the following reaction: \ch{2 Al + 6 HCl -> 2 AlCl3 + 3 H2}
	
	\subsection*{Question 1 (2 points)}
	If you $0.500~g$ of \ch{Al} with $1.500~g$ of \ch{HCl}, which reactant will be the limiting reactant?
	
	\vspace{13em}
	\subsection*{Question 2 (2 points)}
	How many $g$ of each product will be produced?
	
	\vspace{13em}
	\subsection*{Question 3 (1 point)} 
	How many $g$ of the excess reactant will remain after the reaction?

\paragraph{By Audre Lorde}~

\vspace{1em}\noindent
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.56\linewidth}
	For those of us who live at the shoreline\\
	standing upon the constant edges of decision\\
	crucial and alone\\
	for those of us who cannot indulge\\
	the passing dreams of choice\\
	who love in doorways coming and going\\
	in the hours between dawns\\
	looking inward and outward\\
	at once before and after\\
	seeking a now that can breed\\
	futures\\
	like bread in our children’s mouths\\
	so their dreams will not reflect\\
	the death of ours;

	For those of us\\
	who were imprinted with fear\\
	like a faint line in the center of our foreheads\\
	learning to be afraid with our mother’s milk\\
	for by this weapon\\
	this illusion of some safety to be found\\
	the heavy-footed hoped to silence us\\
	For all of us\\
	this instant and this triumph\\
	We were never meant to survive.
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\linewidth}
	And when the sun rises we are afraid\\
	it might not remain\\
	when the sun sets we are afraid\\
	it might not rise in the morning\\
	when our stomachs are full we are afraid\\
	of indigestion\\
	when our stomachs are empty we are afraid\\
	we may never eat again\\
	when we are loved we are afraid\\
	love will vanish\\
	when we are alone we are afraid\\
	love will never return\\
	and when we speak we are afraid\\
	our words will not be heard\\
	nor welcomed\\
	but when we are silent\\
	we are still afraid

	So it is better to speak\\
	remembering\\
	we were never meant to survive.
