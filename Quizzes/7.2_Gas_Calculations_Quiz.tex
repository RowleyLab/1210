	\subsection*{Problem 1 (1 point)}
	Consider the following reaction: \ch{2 KClO3(s) -> 2 KCl(s) + 3 O2(g)}
	
	\noindent $2.5~g$ of \ch{KClO3} are decomposed and the gas product is collected in a balloon. If the system is at STP, what volume of gas will be collected?
	
	\vspace{10em}
	\subsection*{Problem 2 (2 points)}
	What is the density (in $\nicefrac{g}{L}$) of \ch{SF6} gas at STP?
	
	\vspace{10em}
	\subsection*{Problem 3 (2 points)}
	A gas sample is found to have density of $1.53~\dfrac{g}{L}$ at a pressure of $0.85~atm$ and $25^\circ C$. Give a reasonable guess for the chemical identity of the gas.

	For all we have and are,\\
	For all our children's fate,\\
	Stand up and take the war.\\
	The Hun is at the gate!\\
	Our world has passed away,\\
	In wantonness o'erthrown.\\
	There is nothing left to-day\\
	But steel and fire and stone!\\
	Though all we knew depart,\\
	The old Commandments stand:—\\
	“In courage keep your heart,\\
	In strength lift up your hand.”

	Once more we hear the word\\
	That sickened earth of old:—\\
	“No law except the Sword\\
	Unsheathed and uncontrolled.”\\
	Once more it knits mankind,\\
	Once more the nations go\\
	To meet and break and bind\\
	A crazed and driven foe.
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.49\linewidth}
	Comfort, content, delight,\\
	The ages' slow-bought gain,\\
	They shrivelled in a night.\\
	Only ourselves remain\\
	To face the naked days\\
	In silent fortitude,\\
	Through perils and dismays\\
	Renewed and re-renewed.\\
	Though all we made depart,\\
	The old Commandments stand:—\\
	“In patience keep your heart,\\
	In strength lift up your hand.”

	No easy hope or lies\\
	Shall bring us to our goal,\\
	But iron sacrifice\\
	Of body, will, and soul.\\
	There is but one task for all—\\
	One life for each to give.\\
	What stands if Freedom fall?\\
	Who dies if England live?
