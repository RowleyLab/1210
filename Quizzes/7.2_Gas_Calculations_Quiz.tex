	\subsection*{Problem 1 (1 point)}
	Consider the following reaction: \ch{2 KClO3(s) -> 2 KCl(s) + 3 O2(g)}
	
	\noindent $2.5~g$ of \ch{KClO3} are decomposed and the gas product is collected in a balloon. If the system is at STP, what volume of gas will be collected?
	
	\vspace{10em}
	\subsection*{Problem 2 (2 points)}
	What is the density (in $\nicefrac{g}{L}$) of \ch{SF6} gas at STP?
	
	\vspace{10em}
	\subsection*{Problem 3 (2 points)}
	A gas sample is found to have density of $1.53~\dfrac{g}{L}$ at a pressure of $0.85~atm$ and $25^\circ C$. Give a reasonable guess for the chemical identity of the gas.
