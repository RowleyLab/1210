	\subsection*{Question 1 (2 points)}
	A bomb calorimeter has a calibrated heat capacity of $C_{cal}=2.673~\dfrac{kJ}{^\circ C}$
	
	\noindent
	$1.25~g$ of sucrose (\ch{C12H22O11}) are burned in the calorimeter and the temperature rises by $7.71~^\circ C$
	
	\noindent
	Calculate $\Delta H_{rxn}$ for the combustion of sucrose
	
	% -5645 kJ
	
	\vspace{15em}
	\subsection*{Question 2 (3 points)}
	Consider the reaction: \ch{H2S(g) + 2 O2(g) -> SO3(g) + H2O(l)} \hspace{2em} $\Delta H_{rxn} = -207~\dfrac{kJ}{mol}$
	
	\noindent
	If $5.2~g$ of \ch{H2S} are reacted with excess \ch{O2}, how much heat will be released?

\section*{\emph{My Voice}}
\paragraph{By Rafael Campo}~
\begin{verse}
	To cure myself of wanting Cuban songs,\\
	I wrote a Cuban song about the need\\
	For people to suppress their fantasies,\\
	Especially unhealthy ones. The song\\
	Began by making reference to the sea,\\
	Because the sea is like a need so great\\
	And deep it never can be swallowed. Then\\
	The song explores some common myths\\
	About the Cuban people and their folklore:\\
	The story of a little Carib boy\\
	Mistakenly abandoned to the sea;\\
	The legend of a bird who wanted song\\
	So desperately he gave up flight; a queen\\
	Whose strength was greater than a rival kingâ€™s.\\
	The song goes on about morality,\\
	And then there is a line about the sea,\\
	How deep it is, how many creatures need\\
	Its nourishment, how beautiful it is\\
	To need. The song is ending now, because\\
	I cannot bear to hear it any longer.\\
	I call this song of needful love my voice.
