	\subsection*{Question 1 (1 points)}
	$25.00~ml$ of \ch{HCl} with unknown concentration were titrated to the end-point with $37.21~ml$ of $0.150~M$ \ch{NaOH}. Find the initial $\left[\ch{HCl}\right]$

	\subsection*{Question 2 (2 points)}
	$25.00~ml$ of \ch{Ba(OH)2} with unknown concentration were titrated to the end-point with $42.85~ml$ of $0.350~M$ \ch{HNO3}. Find the initial $\left[\ch{Ba(OH)2}\right]$

	\subsection*{Question 3 (2 points)}
	Color-changing indicators are available for redox reactions as well as for acid-base reactions. Consider the following reaction:
	
	\ch{2 Au^{3+}(aq) + 3 Cr^{2+}(aq) -> 2 Au(s) + 3 Cr^{4+}(aq)}
	
	\noindent $50.00~ml$ of \ch{Au(NO3)3} with unknown concentration were titrated to the end-point with $28.63~ml$ of $0.125~M$ \ch{Cr(C2H3O2)2}. Find the initial $\left[\ch{Au(NO3)3}\right]$
